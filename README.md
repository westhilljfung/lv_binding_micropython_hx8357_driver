## Micropython

Micropython Binding for lvgl (LittlelvGL) provides an automatically generated Micropython module with classes and functions that allow the user access much of the lvgl library.  
The module is generated automatically by the script [`gen_mpy.py`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_bindings/blob/master/micropython/gen_mpy.py).  
This script reads, preprocesses and parses lvgl header files, and generates a C file `lv_mpy.c` which defines the Micropython module (API) for accessing lvgl from Micropython.  
Micopython's build script (Makefile) should run `gen_mpy.py` automatically to generate and compile `lv_mpy.c`.

- If you would like to see an example of how a generated `lv_mpy.c` looks like, have a look at [`v_mpy_example.c`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_bindings/blob/master/micropython/lv_mpy_example.c). Note that its only exported (non static) symbol is `mp_module_lvgl` which should be registered in Micropython as a module.  
- An example project that builds Micropython + lvgl + lvgl-bindings: [`lv_mpy`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_mpy)

It's worth noting that the Mircopython Bindings module (`lv_mpy.c`) is dependant on lvgl configuration. lvgl is configured by `lv_conf.h` where different objects and features could be enabled or disabled. lvgl bindings are generated only for the enabled objects and features. Changing `lv_conf.h` requires re running `gen_mpy.py`, therfore it's useful to run it automatically in the build script.

### Memory Management

When lvgl is built as a Micropython library, it is configured to allocate memory using Micropython memory allocation functions and take advantage of Micropython *Garbage Collection* ("gc").  
This means that structs allocated for lvgl use don't need to be deallocated explicitly, gc takes care of that.  
For this to work correctly, lvgl needs to be configured to use gc and to use Micropython's memory allocation functions, and also register all lvgl "root" global variables to Micropython's gc.

### Concurrency

This implementation of Micropython Bindings to lvgl assumes that Micropython and lvgl are running **on a single thread** and **on the same thread** (or alternatively, running without multithreading at all).  
No synchronization means (locks, mutexes) are taken.  
However, asynchronous calls to lvgl still take place periodically for screen refresh and other lvgl tasks such as animation.

This is achieved by using the internal Micropython scheduler (that must be enabled), by calling `mp_sched_schedule`.  
`mp_sched_schedule` is called when screen needs to be refreshed. lvgl expects the function `lv_task_handler` to be called periodically (see [lvgl/README.md#porting](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/blob/6718decbb7b561b68e450203b83dff60ce3d802c/README.md#porting). This is ususally handled in the display device driver.
Here is [an example](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_binding_micropython/blob/77b0c9f2678b6fbd0950fbf27380052246841082/driver/SDL/modSDL.c#L23) of calling `lv_task_handler` with `mp_sched_schedule` for refreshing lvgl. [`mp_lv_task_handler`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_binding_micropython/blob/77b0c9f2678b6fbd0950fbf27380052246841082/driver/SDL/modSDL.c#L7) is scheduled to run on the same thread Micropython is running, and it calls both `lv_task_handler` for lvgl task handling and `monitor_sdl_refr_core` for refreshing the display and handling mouse events.  

With REPL (interactive console), when waiting for the user input, asynchronous events can also happen. In [this example](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_mpy/blob/bc635700e4186f39763e5edee73660fbe1a27cd4/ports/unix/unix_mphal.c#L176) we just call `mp_handle_pending` periodically when waiting for a keypress. `mp_handle_pending` takes care of dispatching asynchronous events registered with `mp_sched_schedule`.

### Structs Classes and globals

The lvgl binding script parses lvgl headers and provides API to access lvgl **classes** (such as `btn`) and **structs** (such as `color_t`). All structs and classes are available under lvgl micropython module.  

lvgl Class contains:
- functions (such as `set_x`)
- enums related to that class (such as `STATE` of a `btn`)

lvgl struct contains only attributes that can be read or written. For example:
```python
c = lvgl.color_t()
c.ch.red = 0xff
```
structs can also be initialized from dict. For example, the example above can be written like this:
```python
c = lvgl.color_t({'ch': {'red' : 0xff}})
```

All lvgl globals (functions, enums, types) are avaiable under lvgl module. For example, `lvgl.SYMBOL` is an "enum" of symbol strings, `lvgl.anim_create` will create animation etc.

### Callbacks

In C a callback is a function pointer.  
In Micropython we would also need to register a *Micropython callable object* for each callback.  
Therefore in the Micropython binding we need to register both a function pointer and a Micropython object for every callback.  

Therefore we defined a **callback convention** that expects lvgl headers to be defined in a certain way. Callbacks that are declared according to the convention would allow the binding to register a Micropython object next to the function pointer when registering a callback, and access that object when the callback is called.  
The Micropython callable object is automatically saved in a `user_data` variable which is provided when registering or calling the callback.

The callback convetion assumes the following:
- There's a struct that contains a field called `void * user_data`.
- A pointer to that struct is provided as the first argument of a callback registration function.
- A pointer to that struct is provided as the first argument of the callback itself.

Another option is that the callback function pointer is just a field of a struct, in that case we expect the same struct to contain `user_data` field as well.

As long as the convention above is followed, the lvgl Micropython binding script would automatically set and use `user_data` when callbacks are set and used.  

From the user perspective, any python callable object (such as python regular function, class function, lambda etc.) can be user as an lvgl callbacks. For example:
```python
lvgl.anim_set_custom_exec_cb(anim, lambda anim, val, obj=obj: obj.set_y(val))
```
In this example an exec callback is registered for an animation `anim`, which would animate the y coordinate of `obj`.  
An lvgl API function can also be used as a callback directly, so the example above could also be written like this:
```python
lv.anim_set_exec_cb(anim, obj, obj.set_y)
```

lvgl callbacks that do not follow the Callback Convention cannot be used with micropython callable objects. A discussion related to adjusting lvgl callbacks to the convention: https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/issues/1036  

The `user_data` field **must not be used directly by the user**, since it is used internally to hold pointers to Micropython objects.

### Display and Input Drivers

LittlevGL can be configured to use different displays and different input devices. More information is available on [LittlevGL documentation](https://docs.littlevgl.com/#Porting).  
Registering a driver is essentially calling a registeration function (for example `disp_drv_register`) and passing a function pointer as a parameter (actually a struct that contains function pointers). The function pointer is used to access the actual display / input device.  
When using LittlevGL with Micropython, it makes more sense to **implement the display and input driver in C**. However, **the device registration is perfomed in the Micropython script** to make it easy for the user to select and replace drivers without building the project and changing C files.  
Technically, the driver can be written in either C or in pure Micropython using callbacks.  

Example:

```python
# init

import lvgl as lv
lv.init()

import SDL
SDL.init()

# Register SDL display driver.

disp_buf1 = lv.disp_buf_t()
buf1_1 = bytes(480*10)
lv.disp_buf_init(disp_buf1,buf1_1, None, len(buf1_1)//4)
disp_drv = lv.disp_drv_t()
lv.disp_drv_init(disp_drv)
disp_drv.buffer = disp_buf1
disp_drv.flush_cb = SDL.monitor_flush
disp_drv.hor_res = 480
disp_drv.ver_res = 320
lv.disp_drv_register(disp_drv)

# Regsiter SDL mouse driver

indev_drv = lv.indev_drv_t()
lv.indev_drv_init(indev_drv) 
indev_drv.type = lv.INDEV_TYPE.POINTER
indev_drv.read_cb = SDL.mouse_read
lv.indev_drv_register(indev_drv)
```

In this example we import SDL. SDL module gives access to display and input device on a unix/linux machine. It contains several objects such as `SDL.monitor_flush`, which are wrappers around function pointers and can be registerd as LittlevGL display and input driver.  
Behind the scences these objects implement the buffer protocol to give access to the function pointer bytes.

Starting from version 6.0, lvgl supports setting the display settings (width, length) on runtime. In this example they are set to 480x320. Color depth is set on compile time.  

Currently supported drivers for Micropyton are 

- SDL unix drivers (display and mouse)
- ILI9341 driver for ESP32.  
- Raw Resistive Touch for ESP32 (ADC connected to screen directly, no touch IC)

Driver code is under `/driver` directory.

Drivers can also be implemented in pure Micropython, by providing callbacks (`disp_drv.flush_cb`, `indev_drv.read_cb` etc.)

### Adding Micropython Bindings to a project

An example project of "Micropython + lvgl + Bindings" is [`lv_mpy`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_mpy).  
Here is a procedure for adding lvgl to an existing Micropython project. (The examples in this list are taken from [`lv_mpy`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_mpy)):

- Add [`lv_bindings`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_bindings) as a sub-module under `lib`.
- Add `lv_conf.h` in `lib`
- Edit the Makefile to run `gen_mpy.py` and build its product automatically. Here is [an example](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_mpy/blob/bc635700e4186f39763e5edee73660fbe1a27cd4/py/py.mk#L122).
- Register lvgl module and display/input drivers in Micropython as a builtin module. [An example](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_micropython/blob/9aded358b13acbcc8c86ff48d2661e8b0a6fe1e3/ports/unix/mpconfigport.h#L227).
- Add lvgl roots to gc roots. [An example](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_micropython/blob/9aded358b13acbcc8c86ff48d2661e8b0a6fe1e3/ports/unix/mpconfigport.h#L311). Configure lvgl to use *Garbage Collection* by setting several `LV_MEM_CUSTOM_*` and `LV_GC_*` macros [example](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_mpy/blob/bc635700e4186f39763e5edee73660fbe1a27cd4/lib/lv_conf.h#L28)
- Something I forgot? Please let me know.

## Micropython Bindings Usage

A simple example: [`advanced_demo.py`](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_binding_micropython/blob/master/gen/examples/advanced_demo.py).
More examples can be found under `/examples` folder.

#### Importing and Initializing LittlelvGL
```python
import lvgl as lv
lv.init()
```
#### Registering Display and Input drivers
```python
import SDL
SDL.init()

# Register SDL display driver.

disp_buf1 = lv.disp_buf_t()
buf1_1 = bytes(480*10)
lv.disp_buf_init(disp_buf1,buf1_1, None, len(buf1_1)//4)
disp_drv = lv.disp_drv_t()
lv.disp_drv_init(disp_drv)
disp_drv.buffer = disp_buf1
disp_drv.flush_cb = SDL.monitor_flush
disp_drv.hor_res = 480
disp_drv.ver_res = 320
lv.disp_drv_register(disp_drv)

# Regsiter SDL mouse driver

indev_drv = lv.indev_drv_t()
lv.indev_drv_init(indev_drv) 
indev_drv.type = lv.INDEV_TYPE.POINTER
indev_drv.read_cb = SDL.mouse_read
lv.indev_drv_register(indev_drv)
```
In this example, SDL display and input drivers are registered on a unix port of Micropython.

Here is an alternative example for ESP32 + ILI9341 drivers:

```python
# Import ESP32 driver 

import lvesp32

#Import ILI9341, initialize it and register it with LittlevGL

import ILI9341 as ili
d = ili.display(miso=5, mosi=18, clk=19, cs=13, dc=12, rst=4, backlight=2)
d.init()
disp_buf1 = lv.disp_buf_t()
buf1_1 = bytes(480*10)
lv.disp_buf_init(disp_buf1,buf1_1, None, len(buf1_1)//4)
disp_drv = lv.disp_drv_t()
lv.disp_drv_init(disp_drv)
disp_drv.buffer = disp_buf1
disp_drv.flush_cb = d.flus
disp_drv.hor_res = 480
disp_drv.ver_res = 320
lv.disp_drv_register(disp_drv)
```

### Creating a screen with a button and a label
```python
scr = lv.obj()
btn = lv.btn(scr)
btn.align(lv.scr_act(), lv.ALIGN.CENTER, 0, 0)
label = lv.label(btn)
label.set_text("Button")

# Load the screen

lv.scr_load(scr)

```

#### Creating an instance of a struct
```python
symbolstyle = lv.style_t(lv.style_plain)
```
symbolstyle would be an instance of `lv_style_t` initialized to the same value of `lv_style_plain`

#### Setting a field in a struct
```python
symbolstyle.text.color = lv.color_hex(0xffffff)
```
symbolstyle.text.color would be initialized to the color struct returned by `lv_color_hex`

#### Setting a nested struct using dict
```python
symbolstyle.text.color = {"red":0xff, "green":0xff, "blue":0xff}
```

#### Creating an instance of an object
```python
self.tabview = lv.tabview(lv.scr_act())
```
The first argument to an object constructor is the parent object, the second is which element to copy this element from.  
Both arguments are optional.

#### Calling an object method
```python
self.symbol.align(self, lv.ALIGN.CENTER,0,0)
```
In this example `lv.ALIGN` is an enum and `lv.ALIGN.CENTER` is an enum member (an integer value).

#### Using callbacks
```python
for btn, name in [(self.btn1, 'Play'), (self.btn2, 'Pause')]:
    btn.set_event_cb(lambda obj=None, event=-1, name=name: self.label.set_text('%s %s' % (name, get_member_name(lv.EVENT, event))))
```

#### Listing available functions/memebers/constants etc.
```python
print('\n'.join(dir(lvgl)))
print('\n'.join(dir(lvgl.btn)))
...
```
